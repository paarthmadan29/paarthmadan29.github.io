# Paarth Madan's Website

This is my personal website built with Hugo and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Content Management

Content is managed exclusively through Notion integration. Posts created in a connected Notion database are automatically synced to this site every 2 hours.

### How It Works

1. Create posts in your Notion database
2. Set the status to "Published"
3. The GitHub Action automatically syncs new/updated posts
4. Changes are deployed to your live site

For setup instructions, see [NOTION_SETUP.md](./NOTION_SETUP.md).

For current status and usage, see [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md).
